<h1>Best Anime Ever Acording to Zach</h1>

<h2>The best anime that I've seen yet!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cowboy Bebop</h3>
    <p>Cowboy Bebop is universally praised for its distinctive animation style, the fusion of genres (melding space and western elements), but stands out to me because of it's groovy soundtrack and immersive storytelling.</p>
<h3>Steins;Gate</h3>
    <p>With a story you almost couldn't recognize from a previous episode; this science fiction series about time-travel hooked me in the very first episode. With well-developed characters and extremely intricate plot, I very well couldn't recognize the same show from the first episode to the last.</p>
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>For one of the longest TV shows in world history I find myself rewatching this show the most. It is a daunting task each time; however, it's extensive world, diverse characters and power structure has captured my heart and become one of my most watched animes. </p>
