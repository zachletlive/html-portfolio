<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Before getting into web developing I worked full-time as a C-130H Propulsion Mechanic at the 182nd AW in Peoria, Illinois. I have been in the Air National Guard since September of 2015, but including Basic Military Training and my Technical Schooling for my job I did start working in Peoria until early January of 2017.</p>
<p>That same year I started school at Western Illinois University to get my degree in Law Enforcement and Justice Administration, and in 2020 I got my Bachelors Degree. However, once I jumped into the field of law enforcement, the more I found it not to be the right fit for me. It was more rewarding to work on plane engines in my military job. So I put in for a full-time position in 2021.</p>
<p>Working full-time I learned so much more than just building my existing knowledge on aircraft systems. I discovered what it was like to lead a group of people to accomplish a goal with a deadline, to properly teach someone complex ideas by breaking them down into easy-to-grasp concepts, and to network with people of many different backgrounds and experiences. But, the one thing that I always took seriously was to never stop learning and improving.</p>
<p>That is why after a conversation with my uncle about getting a Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) certification I though maybe I could be a part of a growing field that can help people navigate the internet. This very website your looking at right now is one that I created, with a multitude of projects that show my growth in learning website design. At the very moment of writing this this website is just a html file, but soon it will be something much more than that and I cant wait for you all to see it.</p>
